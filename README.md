# learning-python-at-the-speed-of-a-carrot
In this repository, I am using project-based learning to learn Python by building small projects. Currently, the projects in this repository are fairly basic and include things like a rock paper scissors game and a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic. However, I am constantly working to improve my skills and will be adding more advanced projects to this repository as I learn more.

Feel free to browse through the repository to see the projects I have completed so far and check back for updates as I continue to learn and build more advanced projects. I hope these projects can serve as a helpful resource for others learning Python as well.
